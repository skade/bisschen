`bisschen` is a ncurses client for notmuch. No, actually, it is my project to learn Rust (and a bit of C and curses) on.

It's in no usable state, but it compiles and runs on my machine. In the near future, it will probably compile on your machine.

Feel free to have a look at it and follow, but expect it to be something completely different by tomorrow.
